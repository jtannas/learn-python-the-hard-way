"""Study Drills
The Study Drills contain things you should try to do. If you can't,
skip it and come back later. For this exercise, try these things:

Q1: Make your script print another line.
A1: Done - 'This line is goningg to be commented out.'

Q2: Make your script print only one of the lines.
A2: Done, then reversed.

Q3: Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did
    it do? Try to find out what this character does.
A3: It gets python to treat the line as a comment, no as code.
