Q1: Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining
    what the line does.
A1: Done.

Q2: Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python? Start python this
    way again and using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.
A2: Done.

Q3: Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that
    does it.
A3: Done.

Q4: Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole
    numbers. You need to use a "floating point" number, which is a
    number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.
A4: Done.

Q5: Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate.
    20.0 is floating point.
A4: Done
