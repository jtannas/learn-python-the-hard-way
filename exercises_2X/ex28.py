Q1: There are a lot of operators in Python similar to != and ==. Try to
    find as many "equality operators" as you can. They should be
    like < or <=.
A1: See answer A2.

Q2: Write out the names of each of these equality operators. For
    example, I call != "not equal."
A2:
    ==  equal
    !=  not equal
    <   less than
    <=  less than or equal to
    >   greater than
    >=  greater than or equal to

Q3: Play with the Python by typing out new boolean operators, and before
    you press Enter try to shout out what it is. Do not think about it.
    Shout the first thing that comes to mind. Write it down, then press
    Enter, and keep track of how many you get right and wrong.
A3: Pass.

Q4: Throw away the piece of paper from 3 away so you do not accidentally
    try to use it later.
A4: Done.
