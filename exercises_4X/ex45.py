"""Exercise 45: You Make a Game.

I am going to pass on this exercise for now. Though I could do it by
converting the code that I wrote for exercise 36 from calling
functions out of global to calling classes, it's not a problem that
grabs my interest. After finishing this book, I will find another
project to work on with classes.
