"""Study Drills
There is only one Study Drill for this exercise because it is a big
exercise. Go and read http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ and
start trying to use it in your code. You'll notice that some of it is
different from what you've been learning in this book, but now you
should be able to understand their recommendations and use them in your
own code. The rest of the code in this book may or may not follow these
guidelines depending on if it makes the code more confusing. I suggest
you also do this, as comprehension is more important than impressing
everyone with you knowledge of esoteric style rules.

A: Done, and I use PyLint and YAPF to do code formatting.
